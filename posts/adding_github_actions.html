      <h1>Adding Github Actions to this blog</h1>
      <p> I went ahead and relaxed a bit with my blog restrictions. In particular, the <q>No JavaScript</q> one. We like
        JS. However, I was not going to do the whole JSON databasing shebang, fetching, caching, etc‚Ä¶, <a
          href='https://github.com/fdch/fdch.github.io' title='like I did before'>like I did before</a>. </p>
      <blockquote> I wanted something simpler. I'd heard about Github actions, but always wanted to try. So here's what
        I did. </blockquote>
      <h3>Tinker with a workflow</h3>
      <p> I added a posts subdirectory in which I place every post I make for this blog. From that directory, I want
        Github Actions to pick up all posts and stack them up into the main index file, in reversed chronological order.
        Every time a new post is added, I need the index file to be updated. Therefore, this needs to happen on every
        push. It boils down to: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a directory for your posts</li>
        <li>Create a function that updates the index file with the new posts</li>
        <li>Execute the update function on every new post</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The first point speaks for itself: put new posts in their own html files and in one subdirectory. Now, for
        point 2, the <em>function</em> can be written in quite any language. I chose to do this on python, because why
        not delve into the rawness of <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html'
          title='that html.parser'>that html.parser</a>. </p>
      
          <p>
            Anyway, after a few hours and a few classes later, the <code>update_posts.py</code> function was finished. It boiled down to three steps:
          </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Grab the index file and clear the section that will include all posts</li>
        <li>For every post, grab it and run a pre-formatter, and sort them in reverse chronological order </li>
        <li>Stack the posts up on the posts section of the index file </li>
      </ol> 
      <p>
        The trick here was to: identify the posts sections in the index file, wrap the individual posts in their own <code>main</code> tag so parsing is easy, and add a <code>time</code> tag on each post with the timestamp for sorting.
      </p>
      
      <blockquote> So, that was it with step 2. It took a while to get the parsing right, but html is such a powerful
        and robust way to structure text that it makes things easy; and, Python and strings do work quite nicely
        together. </blockquote>
      <p> Finally, the gist was setting up a workflow with a yaml file. Here is <a title="Github Gist to auto-update posts" href="https://gist.github.com/fdch/23fd4077d9b8be0bf017ec420e13add5#file-update_posts-yml">the gist</a>:</p>
      <!-- <textarea id="github-gist" name="autoupdate-posts" rows="25" cols="50"> -->
      <pre>
name: Auto-update posts
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setting up python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9.7
      - name: Updating posts
        run: |
          python update_posts.py
      - run: |
          git config user.name github-actions
          git config user.email github-actions@github.com
          git add .
          git commit -m 'Auto-Update posts'
          git push
      </pre>

      <p>The basic steps in the gist above are: <ol>
        <li>Set up python</li>
        <li>Run update_posts.py</li>
        <li>Make and push a commit to github</li>
      </ol> And voil√†, every-time a new post is added to the posts directory this action gets fired up. </p>
      <blockquote> So, that was it for blog systems: completely replaced by a script and a set of instructions, and of
        course, git and the Github Actions backend üòÖ </blockquote>
