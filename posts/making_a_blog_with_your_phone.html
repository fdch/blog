<h2>Making a blog with your 📱</h2>
<p>
  Today, I decided to make a blog with my phone and a Github account.
  Here are the steps that I took to achieve this.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Design a super cool front end 😎</h3>
<blockquote>
  This is absolutely necessary so as to get all your ideas in order, and to Make things exactly as you want
  them rather quickly.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Here is the result:

<h3>Step 2: Make a new repository on Github</h3>
<blockquote>
  Using the web interface: Add a Readme if you want to.
</blockquote>

<p>
  You also need to enable Github Pages on it. Head to <a
    href="https://pages.github.com">https://pages.github.com/</a> to know how to do so.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Simplify</h3>
<blockquote>
  Scratch out everything you don't need
</blockquote>


<p>
  In my case, once the design was layed out, I went ahead and scratched out
  Everything that I thought unnecessary. Hence, there was a lot of stuff like:
  Don't use (json, JavaScript, markdown, etc) and a ✅ for <em>plain HTML</em>.
</p>


<h3>Step 4: Create an index.html file (the one you are reading now) </h3>
<blockquote>This file is the only page you live edit, while readers view it (🤦🏽)</blockquote>

<p>
  This is not that bad, and it is quite thrilling. On one hand, my mistakes are exposed immediately, and
  reading a messy blog is not nice. However, this makes me think really hard about content and layout. I
  must
  have a very clear idea 💡 about what to write and how to write it first, so then I can type it out and
  place
  the cumbersome html tags to display it in a readable way... <I>ok, this is questionable, <s>sue me</s></I>
</p>

<p>
  One thing I found out about is the <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> HTML tags, which made
  collapsing and unfolding possible, and only using html! Fabulous. 🤷🏽‍♂️
<details>
  <summary>Isn't it cool 🙁?</summary>😒
</details>
</p>

<h3>Step 5: Create an style.css file</h3>
<blockquote>At his point your blog looks amazing, well done 👍🏼 </blockquote>


<p>For the style, I went with a <a
    href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-designed-a-colorblind-friendly-palette-8a91a49f1220">colorblind safe
    palette</a> 🎨, used in dark mode,
    And I might change the feel eventually. For now, I just wanted something quickly to get it out there.</p>


<h3>Step 6: Make a first post </h3>
<blockquote>And here it is. Well, the second one ☝️, the first
  One is just a blab about what this blog is. This one is cooler, it has a picture and all.</blockquote>
  
  
  <p>I really liked the picture trick there. I just 📸, upload one to Github as a file. Then I copy the path,
    Come here, and paste it in the <code>src</code> field of the img tag and voilà, I'm the New York Post</p>

<blockquote>That's it! I now have a blog.
  <br>
  What's fun is that there is: No js ☹️, no php 🥲, no frameworks 😅;
  It took less than 2 hs to get it running and write this post 🤩.
  Now it's just a matter of continuing it... 🙃
