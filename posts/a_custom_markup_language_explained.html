        <h1>A custom markup language explained, or how to reinvent the wheel.</h1>
      </header>
      <blockquote>So, I <a href="../posts/example.html">made a text parser</a>  but I did not really explain how it works. Here‚Äôs my attempt.</blockquote>
      <p>It all started with a need to write posts directly on my phone. Doing so in HTML proved to be quite cumbersome. Every element had to be opened, filled with text and/or attributes, and then closed. It became, besides a nuisance, quite error prone. My phone‚Äôs error correction and auto capitalization made HTML tags look really funny, and they broke most of the time. Therefore, I needed some way to input text and have the HTML elements properly set.</p>
      <h2>Post Factory: Enter Google Sheets‚Ä¶ and a lot of copy-pasting</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôm not sure why, but I tend to use Sheets for everything. That‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your call; I just overdo it sometimes. In several occasions, Sheets is the way to go; most often the case is quite the opposite. Anyhow, I came up with a plausible solution:
 	1.	A column of HTML elements: ‚Äúp‚Äù
 	2.	B column of input text: ‚ÄúMy paragraph‚Ä¶‚Äù
 	3.	C column that would grab the tag from A and fill it with text from B into a nicely formatted HTML element, alla:</p>
      <pre class="language-html" title="html" data-language="html">&lt;p&gt;My paragraph‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
      <h2>The last cell</h2>
      <blockquote>Voil√†! I did not stop there, though.</blockquote>
      <p>The Sheet grew with separate tabs for meta tags, and finally, for the complete HTML file. The last cell grabbed the text from all other cells and outputted an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>  root element with the content of the entire post. Thus, I had a created template factory for blog posts, entirely with Google Sheets and string concatenation. Fancy stuff.</p>
      <blockquote>‚Ä¶well, not so fancy.</blockquote>
      <h2>copy pasting hell</h2>
      <h2>Formatting problems</h2>
      <p>This involved copying and pasting so much text, so many times, across apps on my phone, that it was unsustainable. After four or five posts I was done with it. I wanted a better way.</p>
      <p>Another problem was the formatting. The resultant markup was a single line of a text file. Completely impractical for editing.</p>
      <blockquote>To solve this, I added some new lines within the cell text parsing (in Sheets that is called CHAR(10) or CHAR(13)), only to find that these reconfigured how Sheets formatted the cells: it introduced nasty surrounding quotes! Ugh, what a pain for the unhappy copy-paster.</blockquote>
      <h2>A new hope: üêç</h2>
      <p>I thought of a new way to make posts. I would use Markdown, a hip, simple, and modern text markup language with many available editors for iOS. With minimal code, text is very nicely set on the page and many languages have parsing libraries for it.</p>
      <h2>I did not want to use pip in the github workflow ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
      <blockquote>Python has many markdown libs, so I could make a python script that parses a <code>.md</code>  file into an <code>.html</code>  file and place it inside the <code>posts</code>  directory before the <code>update_posts.py</code>  scripts updates the landing page. I was getting excited by the minute</blockquote>
      <p>In order to get any markdown library into my python version on the ubuntu shell up accessed by the Github Actions workflow, I needed to run <code>pip install markdown</code>  or similar before running the process. Or, better yet, I needed to make a virtual environment for python and activate it before running python. Ugh, I did not want to do any of that.</p>
      <blockquote>If my experience with Pure Data has anything to add here, it would be that vanilla is usually the way to go.</blockquote>
      <p>Therefore, I just went ahead and decided to parse the text myself using only the standard (vanilla) python. That is, only using what comes with python version &gt;= 3.9. Why not?!</p>
      <h2>I started writing a post with made-up tags and I would sort it out later.</h2>
      <p>I have no other way of making up a parser like this. I am not a pure-bred programmer, and I am not a language expert, so I cannot start thinking in terms of meta-language descriptors, or formal grammar, etc. Besides, this was a simple markup. And, I needed to KISS (keep it simple, stupid) üôÉ So, I started making it up as I went.</p>
      <h2>The result</h2>
      <blockquote>Funny thing, while writing this post I realized that I did not include hyperlinks. HYPERLINKS! The Internet gods forgive me ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I hope to include them before writing this post. If that worked, I should be able to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">understand what hyperlinks are</a> , finally ü§ì.</blockquote>
