title: I made a text parser to make easier posts 😇 
description: This is a post about an example post. This description must reside in a single line of any lenght. Just don't do any newlines here and you'll be good.
keywords: these, are, keywords, separated, by, commas, like, programming, blogging, composition, music, databasing

This post is written in plain text and parsed with a custom parser.
It's similar to markdown, but slightly different.

| And this is a block quote text, pretty cool, eh?

subtitle: This is my first subtitle

<details><summary>Testing</summary>
Some <b>stuff</b>...</details>


This is a paragraph. Continuing
on the same line

This is another paragraph

subtitle: this is a subtitle

- this is an unordered list
- with items
- many items

some paragraph and then, a blockquote

| telling you some stuff

subtitle: yet another title

<h3>You can even set your own html tags</h3>

<p>This is a paragraph coming straignt 
from html stuff</p>

```js
// this is a js comment
() => window.alert("ok, this is cool");
```

1. this is an ordered list
2. with three items
3. and, yes, I said three
