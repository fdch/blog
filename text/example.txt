title: I made a text parser to make easier posts üòá 
description: This is a post about an example post. This description must reside in a single line of any lenght. Just don't do any newlines here and you'll be good.
keywords: these, are, keywords, separated, by, commas, like, programming, blogging, composition, music, databasing

// This is a comment. Markdown has no comments ;)

This post is written in plain text and parsed with a custom parser.
It's similar to [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), but slightly different.

| And this is a block quote text, pretty `cool`, eh?

subtitle: This is my first subtitle

<details><summary>Testing</summary>
Some <b>stuff</b>...</details>


This is a paragraph. Continuing
on the same line

from html stuff</p>

```js
// this is a js comment
() => window.alert("ok, this is cool");
```

1. this is an ordered list
2. The second one being a link [click here](http://localhost:8000)
3. and, yes, I said three

| final notes, thank you for reading. üòÅ

The text `first node`, first code's tail `second node` second node's tail.
Also, we can have a `third code element` with another tail...
