<h2>Making a blog with your ðŸ“±</h2>
<p>Today, I decided to make a blog with my phone and a Github account. 
Here are the steps that I took to achieve this.</p>
<dl>
<di>Step 1: Design a super cool front end ðŸ˜Ž</di>
<dd>This is absolutely necessary so as to get all your ideas in order, and to
Make things exactly as you want them rather quickly. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is the result:</p>

<dl>
<di>Step 2: Make a new repository on Github</di>
<dd>Using the web interface: Add an index.html (the one you are reading now)</dd>
</dl>

<p>And if you get fancy, you can add your own style.css file, or grab the one this HTML file is linking </p>

<dl>
<di>Step 3: Simplify</di>
<dd>Scratch out everything you don't need</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In my case, once the design was layed out, I went ahead and scratched out 
Everything that I thought unnecessary. Hence, there was a lot of stuff like: 
Don't use (json, JavaScript, markdown, etc) and a âœ… for "plain HTML".
