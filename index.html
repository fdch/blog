<h2>Making a blog with your 📱</h2>
<p>Today, I decided to make a blog with my phone and a Github account. 
Here are the steps that I took to achieve this.</p>
<dl>
<di>Step 1: Design a super cool front end 😎</di>
<dd>This is absolutely necessary so as to get all your ideas in order, and to
Make things exactly as you want them rather quickly. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is the result:</p>

<dl>
<di>Step 2: Make a new repository on Github</di>
<dd>Using the web interface: Add an Readme if you want.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<di>Step 3: Simplify</di>
<dd>Scratch out everything you don't need</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In my case, once the design was layed out, I went ahead and scratched out 
Everything that I thought unnecessary. Hence, there was a lot of stuff like: 
Don't use (json, JavaScript, markdown, etc) and a ✅ for "plain HTML". 
</p>

<dl>
<di>Step 4: Create an index.html file (the one you are reading now) </di>
<dd>This file is the only page you live edit, while readers view it (🤦🏽)</dd>
</dl>

<p>This is not that bad, and it is quite thrilling. On one hand, my mistakes are exposed immediately,
 and reading a messy blog is not nice. However, this makes me think really hard about content and layout. 
I must have a very clear idea 💡 about what to write and how to write it first, so then I can type it out
and place the cumbersome html tags to display it in a readable way... <I>ok, this is questionable, <s>sue me</s></I></p>

<p>One thing I found out about is the <code>details</code> And <code>summary</code> Tags, which made collapsing and unfolding 
Possible, and only using html! Fabulous. 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>

<dl>
<di>Step 5: Create an style.css file</di>
<dd>At his point your blog looks amazing, well done 👍🏼 </dd>
</dl>

<p>For the style, I went with a <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-designed-a-colorblind-friendly-palette-8a91a49f1220">colorblind safe palette</a> 🎨, used in dark mode,
And I might change the feel eventually. For now, I just wanted something quickly to get it out there.</p>

<dl>
<di>Step 6: Make a first post </di>
<dd>And here it is. Well, the second one ☝️, the first
One is just a blab about what this blog is. This one is cooler, it has a picture and all.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I really liked the picture trick there. I just 📸, upload one to Github as a file. Then I copy the path,
Come here, and paste it in the "src" field of the img tag and voilà, I'm the New York Post</p>

<blockquote>That's it! I now have a blog. It took 2 hs to get it running and write this post. Now it's just a matter of continuing it... 🙃</blockquote>
